I am a PhD student in Population Biology co-advised by Dr. Rachael Bay and Dr. Anya Brown where I am investigating cryptic *Acropora* species in the Cook Islands. This project looks to answer questions regarding the distribution of cryptic species and the eco-evolutionary consequences of various abiotic and biotic drivers such as symbiont association and temperature. I am broadly interested in adaptation and plasticity both between and within species and what allows species or individuals to live and prosper where they are. 

My mood is directly correlated with my proximity to the ocean. I love tide-pooling, diving, snorkeling, camping, and hiking. Apart from nature related activities, I have 2 tuxedo cats named Watson and Percival and I enjoy stationery, crocheting, and reading.
