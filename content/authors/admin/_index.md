I am interested in how human influences on the environment alter the evolutionary trajectories of organisms. I use a combination of ecological experiments and genomic analysis to identify genetic variation underlying adaptation in natural populations and to understand how adaptive variation is distributed across environments. I am particularly interested in developing predictive genomic frameworks that can be used to estimate the potential for adaptation to future environmental change. I have a particular fondness for marine systems, although I have worked in a broad range of taxa.

In my spare time I enjoy baking, hiking, and spending time with my husband and toddler.
