I am a PhD Student in the Bay Lab and the Population Biology Graduate Group at UC Davis, where I am investigating the eco-evolutionary responses to environmental stress in ribbed limpets (cryptic species complex: *Lottia digitalis* and *Lottia austrodigitalis*. More broadly, my research interests lie in characterizing the adaptive potential of populations and understanding how marine species will respond to climate change. I am excited about using genomic tools to answer questions that affect conservation and how people can feed themselves from marine resources. I am also passionate about environmental and social justice. Outside of science, I enjoy yoga, dancing, hiking, and napping on the beach.
