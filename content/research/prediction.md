### Predicting evolutionary responses to climate change

<p style="font-size:18px">In addition to exploring past and current patterns of adaptation, we are interested in integrating data from genome scans into more future-oriented predictive frameworks. Once we have an estimate of the genetic basis of adaptation across contemporary environmental gradients, we can use this information to predict population persistence and vulnerability under predicted future climate change scenarios. In corals, we have used simulations to predict population trajectories under warming ocean temperatures. In migratory birds, we estimated which populations would require the greatest genetic shifts to keep up with future climate change, finding that those populations were already declining over recent decades. We are now expanding on this work both by refining methods used for prediction and looking to the past using historical samples to ground truth our methods.</p>
