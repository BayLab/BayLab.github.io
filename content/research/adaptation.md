### Adaptation across environmental gradients

<p style="font-size:18px">One mechanism for species to persist across a wide range of environments is through adaptation to local environmental conditions. In high gene flow systems like marine environments, local adaptation was traditionally thought to be rare, but the recent rise of genomic data has led to the discovery of environmentally-associated genetic structuring in otherwise open populations. We use a field experiments and genomic sequencing to understand the maintenance and mechanisms of local adaptation in natural populations. In corals, we established differences in fitness-related traits (survival and growth) across a small-scale temperature gradient and identified genetic variation associated with individuals living in hotter environments. We are now delving deeper into the co-evolution of traits associates with thermal tolerance in corals within and across species. We are also using similar methods to examine genomic adaptation to temperature or other anthropogenic stressors in a range of taxa including birds, urchins, and seagrass.</p>
