### Evolutionary dynamics of species range shifts

<p style="font-size:18px">Under anthropogenic climate change, the notion that biogeographic boundaries are stable over ecological timescales is no longer tenable. Examples of rapid range shifts associated with climate change now prevail across both terrestrial and marine systems. Such contemporary shifts in species’ distributions may have profound impacts on population dynamics, species interactions, and ecosystem function, and highlight the urgency for understanding and predicting responses to climate change. At the same time, they provide unique opportunities to disentangle fundamental demographic and selective processes that occur during range shifts. We are currently working to understand evolutionary causes and consequences of range shifts in two different systems. In Anna’s hummingbird, we are using genomic data to identify signals of selection during the rapid range expansion from California to Alaska that occurred over the past half century. In owl limpets, we are using a combination of genomic and demographic data to test whether selection at the leading edge of the species range can facilitate further range expansion. These studies can further add to our understanding of the evolutionary effects of human-induced range shifts.</p>
