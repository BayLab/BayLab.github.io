### The role of phenotypic plasticity in environmental response

<p style="font-size:18px">Perhaps the most rapid response to environmental change is acclimation, when individual organisms adjust their physiology to cope with new environments. Although this process is widespread, we are just beginning to define the rates, limits, and underlying cellular mechanisms. Coral reefs are important systems for acclimation studies, as they provide roughly one billion people with food and income, yet are extremely vulnerable to temperature shifts. Using a combination of laboratory manipulations and field transplants, we previously documented that acclimation can have a large effect on thermal tolerance in corals and can occur very quickly. We documented gene expression outcomes associated with acclimation, including an overall dampening of the transcriptional response to heat stress. Now we are using epigenomic sequencing to understand the basis for this gene regulatory response and how it differs among closely related species.</p>
